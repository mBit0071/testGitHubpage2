# testGitHubpage2

This is a test2.

## to run jekyll locally
run in the directory:
> jekyll serve --watch --baseurl ""

### Things to keep in mind
1. Jekyll is very specific with it's names. Ex: "YYYY-MM-DD-Title".
1. Posts are picked automatically. If the posts do not have date in front of them, they would not be picked. This can be used as drafts.
1. Links are tricky. 
	1. Always include {{site.baseurl}}
	1. They work differently between local and online.
	
### Todo:
- [x] fixed links between pages.
- [x] box layout for post.
- [x] Landing pages for categories.

### Ideas:
1. Landing pages for categories.
1. Lyrics for landing pages.

## layouts
1. default
1. post
1. null
1. about
1. page
