# testGitHubpage2

This is a test2.

## to run jekyll locally
run in the directory:
> jekyll serve --watch --baseurl ""

### Things to keep in mind
1. Jekyll is very specific with it's names. Ex: "YYYY-MM-DD-Title".
1. Posts are picked automatically. If the posts do not have date in front of them, they would not be picked. This can be used as drafts.

### Todo:
- [x] fixed links between pages
- [x] box layout for post

## layouts
1. default
1. post
1. null
1. about
1. page
